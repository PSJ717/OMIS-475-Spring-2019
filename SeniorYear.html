<h1>Senior year in OM&IS</h1>
<h2>Pierre Sanders-Jackson</h2>
<p>Beginning this year, i started last semester with a huge plate to take in based on my classes. Each one was more hands-on with a strong emphasis on data analytics. It was very exciting to go through what i did because it got me much more knowledgeable of my field of study while also helping me to find more skills to put under my belt to continue to become versatile. Last semester was the beginning, as this semester brings on the second serving, but long story short: I have great professors and resources here at the college of business to give me a spring when needed. It's time to finish strong so lets get to busienss.</p>
