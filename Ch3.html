<!-- Question 1 -->
<p style="background-color:Green; color:White;"> This polar vortex that has come through this week has been something that has been very cool (no pun intended). I stepped outside yestarday, which was the coldest day, and just walked up and down the pathway in front of my apartment complex. At first i didnt think it was really that cold, but then the wind blew. you could feel the cold start to creep up and the crazy thing is that it was so subtle! Breathing it in after like a minute also opened my eyes to the severity of the wind chill. A facemask will be the next investment for the future. </p>
