          <p>OMIS 473 or "data Visualization" really opened my eyes of data analytics and the importance on how to present data in a meanigful way to an audience. At the end of the semster, we were assigned a group project where we had to choose a data set and write a analysis paper along with providing 9 or more visualizations that we learned throughout the semester. This project can be found in the link below.
