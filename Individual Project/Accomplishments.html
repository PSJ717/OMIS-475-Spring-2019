        <center><h2>Featured in NIU Media</h2></center>
        <p>Representing NIU in a positive way is something i believe almost every student wants to do. Walking around campus and seeing the pictures and videos of classmates for NIU promotionals was always very cool to me. How they got the great off-guard pics, the special lighting, the editing, etc was art to me. It was during last year and this year that the College of Business chose some off-gurad pictures of me to be featured on some websites and even in the freshman orientation calender given out during the summer. they didnt have to choose me but its truly an accomplishment to see your face on something promoting a great university. </p>

        <center><h2>First-Generation College Graduate</h2></center>
        <p>Within my immediate family, there were some who went to school but stopped because of life circumstances or plain just flunked out. Some didnt even go for the greater majority of my family which always leaves a stigma for those who are younger coming up. Me personally, my parents kept it in my head to do my very best in school so i could go to a good university, make something of myself, and be a contributor to society. I kept that drive in the back of my head and started to really have a love for school as the years went along. Being here today and looking back, its a blessing to be making this project because ive come along way just all of you guys. When i walk the stage, everything is going to be worth it to reach this great milestone in my life.  </p>

        <center><h2>Scholarship Recipient</h2></center>
        <p>I had never before recieved a scholarship in school which was super wierd to me because they have one for literally everything nowadays. I was realy lazy coming out of high school when it came to applying for scholarships so i missed out on a ton of free money. Here at NIU, they have a great system where you fill out an general form application and it send sit to very scholarship offered at the university. I receievd a letter last april saying that i recieved the CAN/AZEL Memorial scholarship and i was very excited! It was a blessing that someone chose me out of other students so i was really grateful.  </p>

        <p>The Association of information Technology Professionals is an organization based out of the OM&IS department that brings together other OM&IS students for us to network and learn the growing world of IT. We bring in some of the leading compnies in the Operations and IT fields to give information on trends they see increasing, their own personal business stories, and to give information, of course, on their companies. I am the current Vice-President of AITP and my time in the organization has been filled with fun and lots of information gathering. I hope to stay connected to continue to help future students to grow in the IT field as well. </p>
