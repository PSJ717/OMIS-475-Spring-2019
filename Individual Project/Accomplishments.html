        <center><h2>Featured in NIU Media</h2></center>
        <p>Representing NIU in a positive way is something i believe almost every student wants to do. Walking around campus and seeing the pictures and videos of classmates for NIU promotionals was always very cool to me. How they got the great off-guard pics, the special lighting, the editing, etc was art to me. It was during last year and this year that the College of Business chose some off-gurad pictures of me to be featured on some websites and even in the freshman orientation calender given out during the summer. they didnt have to choose me but its truly an accomplishment to see your face on something promoting a great university. </p>

        <center><h2>First-Generation College Graduate</h2></center>
        <p>Within my immediate family, there were some who went to school but stopped because of life circumstances or plain just flunked out. Some didnt even go for the greater majority of my family which always leaves a stigma for those who are younger coming up. Me personally, my parents kept it in my head to do my very best in school so i could go to a good university, make something of myself, and be a contributor to society. I kept that drive in the back of my head and started to really have a love for school as the years went along. Being here today and looking back, its a blessing to be making this project because ive come along way just all of you guys. When i walk the stage, everything is going to be worth it to reach this great milestone in my life.  </p>

        <center><h2>Scholarship Recipient</h2></center>
        <p>I had never before recieved a scholarship in school which was super wierd to me because they have one for literally everything nowadays. I was realy lazy coming out of high school when it came to applying for scholarships so i missed out on a ton of free money. Here at NIU, they have a great system where you fill out an general form application and it send sit to very scholarship offered at the university. I receievd a letter last april saying that i recieved the CAN/AZEL Memorial scholarship and i was very excited! It was a blessing that someone chose me out of other students so i was really grateful.  </p>

        <center><h2>Built my own database</h2></center>
        <p>During my OMIS 452 class, we built a database based off of our own ideas. Mine was based on a medical database that patients could linked all their information into that way during visits, they would not have to go through the paperwork every time. I never did that before so this was a major accomplishment for me. </p>
