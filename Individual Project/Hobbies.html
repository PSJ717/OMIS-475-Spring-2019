                    <p>Basketball has been my favorite sport since my junior year of high school. This was the year that I actually began to play the sport and i founbd out quickly that it is not as easy as it looks! I enjoy watching the NBA and NCAA college basketball alot especially during the playoffs. My two favorite players are both shooting guards: James Harden and Devin Booker.</p>

                    <center><h2>Drums</h2></center>
                    <p>I first got interested in the drums when i was 10 years old. i walked into church and seen the drummer play that Sinday and i immeadiately was just glued to his kit each week. Soon after i began to self-teach myself how to play and make music out of creative ideas. I purchased my first drumset my econd year of college and that is when i started to take my talent to the next level and focus more on this passion of mine. I currently play for my church here in DeKalb and i plan on building a studio in my house in the future.</p>
