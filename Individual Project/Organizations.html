I am currently the Vice President and acting Treasurer of CEO. seeing this organization grow from the ground up has been wonderful and eye openeing at what can happen when you get around people with like minded ideas and passions.

        <p>The Association of information Technology Professionals is an organization based out of the OM&IS department that brings together other OM&IS students for us to network and learn the growing world of IT. We bring in some of the leading compnies in the Operations and IT fields to give information on trends they see increasing, their own personal business stories, and to give information, of course, on their companies. I am the current Vice-President of AITP and my time in the organization has been filled with fun and lots of information gathering. I hope to stay connected to continue to help future students to grow in the IT field as well. </p>
